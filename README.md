# 📧 Spam Email Classifier – End-to-End ML Project (EDA + Training + Deployment)

This notebook builds a complete **Spam Email Classifier** using:

- Text preprocessing (NLP)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Three ML models:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model evaluation & comparison
- Saving models as `.joblib` files
- Simple **Streamlit** web app for deployment

We will use the dataset: **Spamdata.csv**

> The final app predicts whether an email is **Spam** or **Not Spam**, using multiple models and a majority voting approach, similar to the Streamlit app described in the project README. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
